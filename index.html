        then SP Applications because it must reload the page from scratch when ever u want to go to another page or get
        new data MPA’s, front-end and back-end are more interdependent. All coding is usually under one project.MPA s
        gets higher ranking on google seo

      <h3 class="faq-title">DOM vs Virtual DOM</h3>
      <p class="faq-text"> <strong>DOM</strong> is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML it
        contains all the properties methods andevents of html elements. HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change,
        add, or delete HTML elements.if u make achange in ur html u have to refresh ur page to see the change. <br>
        <strong>The virtual DOM (VDOM)</strong> is a programming concept where an ideal or virtual representation of a
        UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM. it only changes the component which is changed or altered
        without reloading or refreshing whole application

      <h3 class="faq-title">Oneway Data Binding vs Two way</h3>
      <p class="faq-text"> <strong>One-way data binding</strong><br>
        One-way data-binding means the data flows in a single direction so that whenever the data changes in a
        component, it also updates the view with new data.
        <br>
        <strong>Two-way data binding</strong><br>
        Two-way data binding means data flows in both directions, it means any change happens in the view updates the
        data and any change happens in the data updates the view.
